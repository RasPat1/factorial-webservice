Tired of finding an amazing closed formula that you think is O(1) but ends up with a factorial in it?  Yeah i'm sure that happens like all the time.  So here's a webservice that allows for constant time lookups for factorial of any value (kinda).  It runs in the background all the time calculating and storing factorials so you don't have to.
